                    As far I can remember, I was fascinated with all that electronics and computers
                    mean. I was a curious person from an early age. I used to dismantle and dissect 
                    a product and often I wouldn't stop until I knew what would make the device tick. 
                    My first “real” taste of computers came when my mother gifted me a laptop for my 
                    4th birthday. It was an overkill laptop for a kid of my age and the poor thing 
                    got hammered. On good old windows XP, I used to verify the function of every 
                    button, switch and checkbox to the point that every couple of weeks I needed 
                    to send my laptop to a computer service because of his OS being so dysfunctional, 
                    most of the times, couldn’t even boot properly in the OS. In conclusion, that 
                    was the beginning of my “great journey” into the world of software.

                    I like games a lot and I enjoy analysing all the little details, especially in 
                    regards to UI/UX. Two years ago, I started making my own projects. That might 
                    have been a little late, bearing in my mind that I’ve been interested in 
                    programming all my life. I started creating small web design concepts which I 
                    further continued to improve and experiment with.

                    One of my hobby is to code. I started in with web design because it’s the most 
                    accessible way to make an UI concept. Using the skills learnt, I created my own 
                    website: simonedifonzo.com. Project that I started at the beginning of October this 
                    year. On the website, there are some of my past projects in which I used to 
                    experiment with different design ideas.
